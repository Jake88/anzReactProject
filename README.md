## Developer notes:

### CSS:
I chose not to add any visual libraries, as I feel defining initial styles - _while inefficient!_ - is a better wya to demonstrate extensive css knowledge.

I chose not to add sass which makes the css files less pretty. This was simply for time constraints, as I believe what styles I've used are adequate and demonstrate my ability to style responsively.

I'm aware that SASS and more adstracted react components would have allowed a much neater and re-usable css structure.

### Components:
I did not abstract down form elements, or use a library. I understand I can, and should for better reusability but for time sake I believe the current implementation demonstrates my ability to create react components.

I am aware that a _good_ react application will create minimalist components that can build a library for re-use, such as form elements and content containers. 

### Testing:
I have tested api-manager and search-bar components to demonstrate my ability to unit test within React. I did have difficulties testing search-bar as the component exists within __withRouter__. I struggled to find a good resource to help solve this.
